# Variables
---
## `string`
---
* Empty string can be initialized using `""` or `string.Empty`
- String Interpolation: `$"{myVariable}"`
- String manipulation creates a copy in memory each time
- `\` is the *escape character*
- `@` is the *string literal*. Prefix a string with `@` and all characters are treated as regular characters
- Can mix escape character and string literal using `$@`

## `int`
---
- Initial value is `0`
- `int` or explicitly a signed `Int32` can range from `-2,147,483,648` to` 2,147,483,647`
- Unsigned integer or `UInt32` ranges from `0` to `4,294,967,295`
- Decimals values are truncated

## `double`
---
- Can have a decimal point
- When writing arithmetic operations, whole numbers are **explicitly integers**, so only using whole numbers will return an `int`. To return a `double`, include a decimal in any number in the operation

## `decimal`

## `bool`

## `null`
